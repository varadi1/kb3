# Tasks update

## Checking tasks statuses

1. READ ~/Tasks.md specifically focus your attention to the open tasks.
2. Analyse the codebase to determine if each of those open tasks are still to be done or have been completed or became obsolite. Please do this one by one for each open task.
3. Based on your results update the task statuses in ~/Tasks.md file. Change priorities and/or add context if you think it is necessary and was missing, but be concise short, keep the structure and do not make duplicates.
please update the ~/tasks.md so the use of the task status symbols are consistent.   â”‚
4. Please make sure to have 1. '[ ]' for open tasks, 2. '[o]' for tasks that are in   progress 3. '[x]' for tasks that are completed, 4. '[?]' for pending tasks, 5.'[ðŸ”´]' for blocked tasks, and 6. '[! ]' for identified bugs to be fixed.  Please also update the status legend accordingly to mirror these statuses. I like the structre of the document that it has a current status overview, Blocked task and bugs to fix grouped by priorities, then open tasks and in progress tasks grouped by priorities, then pending tasks grouped by priorities and last copleted tasks towards the end grouped by completition date. I would like to have the completed tasks with completition dates towards the end of the document, and the open tasks at the beginning grouped by priority.
