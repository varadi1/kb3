description: Finalize a Claude Code session with updating the project context

# Session Finalization

## updating context files

1. UPDATE docs/functions.md if necessary changes to be able to later understand project functions/endpoints/types/classes/variables/enums/tests, etc. Keep your updates structured short and concise.
2. UPDATE Troubleshooting.md with solutions and fixes to problems that have not been added yet. Simplify and group similar items together, but make sure you keep sufficient context to be able to use the knowledge later to identify similar issues and to apply solutions. Structure and organize the document so it is well structured, clean, easy to understand and there are no duplicates. Keep your updates structured short and concise.
3. UPDATE tasks in Archon with what has been done recently and what is ahead to do. Simplify and group similar items together, but make sure you keep sufficient context to be able to use the knowledge later to complete tasks. 
4. git commit the changes

## status message

Please give a very condensed, incredibly nicely formatted, funny, structured and visually pleasing feedback message (many icons) with the summary of what you have done.
