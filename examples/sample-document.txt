Sample Document for Knowledge Base Testing
==========================================

This is a sample text document used for testing the knowledge base system.

## Introduction

This document contains various types of content to test different aspects of text processing:

1. Plain text paragraphs
2. Lists and structured content
3. Special characters and formatting

## Content Sections

### Text Processing

The knowledge base system should be able to extract and process the following types of content:

- **Headings and structure** - Like the ones used in this document
- **Links and references** - For example: https://example.com
- **Lists and enumeration** - Both numbered and bulleted lists
- **Special formatting** - Such as *italics*, **bold**, and `code snippets`

### Sample Data

Here's some sample data that might be found in documents:

Name: John Smith
Email: john.smith@example.com
Phone: (555) 123-4567
Address: 123 Main St, Anytown, USA 12345

### Tables and Structured Data

The system should handle basic table structures:

Product     Price   Quantity
--------    -----   --------
Widget A    $10.99  15
Widget B    $25.50  8
Widget C    $5.75   32

### Technical Information

- API Endpoint: https://api.example.com/v1/data
- Database: PostgreSQL 13.x
- Framework: Node.js with TypeScript
- Testing: Jest with 95% coverage

## Conclusion

This sample document provides various content types for testing:
- Multiple heading levels
- Different text formatting
- Structured data representation
- URLs and email addresses
- Mixed content types

The knowledge base system should extract meaningful information from all these elements and make them searchable and accessible.
